== Paragraphs

General syntax:

--------------------------------------
[<STYLE>]
Some text. Not broken by
blank lines.
--------------------------------------

Valid styles are: literal, verse, quote, listing, TIP, NOTE, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION, abstract, partintro, comment, example, sidebar, source, music, latex, graphviz

Examples:

=== Normal paragraphs

Code:

[listing]
--
How do you achieve a good balance between the test and control group? One good way is to 'randomize' the subjects. You can do this by randomly assigning all the subjects to one group or the other, or by first stratifying them into similar subsets, and then randomly assigning members from each subset into the test and control groups. It wouldn't do for the experimenter to assign subjects to one group or the other after having met the subjects; the experimenter might (consciously or unconsciously) assign healthier patients to one group.

In some cases, you can assign all subjects to both groups: in psychology experiments that measure things like reaction time, you can every subject try every experimental condition (in randomized order), because there is little or no influence between each trial. Obviously, you can't have subjects try every possibility on things like cardiac operations: you can only choose one option for each subject.
